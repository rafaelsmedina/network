# Lollapalooza artists

This was the first small project for the course.

Consists in getting a list of artists that played on the brazilian version of Lollapalooza (2012 - 2017) and connect them based on Spotify's 'Relatd artists' metric.

There is also a visualization using the d3plus framework.
